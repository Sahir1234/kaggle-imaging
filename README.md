# Kaggle Image Segmentation

This code was written for a Kaggle data classification challenge to detect nuclei in photoes taken by a microscope. It. involves processing the image and then looking for separate instances of an object. The locations of these masks are then run length encoded. The run length encoding function was based off of an open source repository created by Kaggle user rakhlin.
